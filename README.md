# Rust_Learning
A repo of rust projects that I'm using to learn the rust langauge 

## Guessing Game
Made using this tutorial: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html 
Has:
    - User input 
    - Random number gen
    - Checking using match and compare 

## Advent of Code
The other projects are solutions to the 2022 advent of code 

These were used to help learn the rust programming langauge
